Requirements:

1. Program randomly choose a number between 1 and 100
2. Ask user their guess
3. Respond with if their guess matches or if their guess is higher/lower than the generated number
4. Game continues until user says "stop"

2. Throw an exception if the user enters a number over 100
3. Throw an exception if the user enters a negative number or 0
4. Keep track of the user's win/loss record
5. Give points to the user based on number of attempts until guessed correctly

### String Calculator Improvement

1. Allow different deliminators besides the comma
2. Allow for spaces between the deliminator and the number
